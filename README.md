# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented using Python's `turtle` module. The player controls a snake that grows in length each time it eats food. The game wraps around the screen, meaning if the snake goes off one edge, it reappears on the opposite edge.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
  - `Up` arrow: Move up
  - `Down` arrow: Move down
  - `Left` arrow: Move left
  - `Right` arrow: Move right
- Press `P` to pause/resume the game.

## Game Rules
- The snake grows longer each time it eats the food.
- The game resets if the snake runs into itself.

## Features
- Simple snake movement and food collision detection.
- Pause and resume functionality with the `P` key.
- Infinite boundary wrapping (snake reappears on the other side of the screen when it moves out of bounds).

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the `snake_game.py` file.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without running into yourself!

## Suggested Improvements
Here are some ideas for enhancing the game:
1. **Add a Score System**: Track and display the player's score, which increases with each food the snake eats.
2. **Game Over Screen**: Instead of immediately resetting the game, show a "Game Over" screen and allow the player to restart.
3. **Wall Collisions**: Make the game more challenging by removing the boundary wrapping and ending the game if the snake hits the wall.
4. **Speed Variation**: Increase the speed of the snake as it grows longer, or add a level system where the difficulty increases as you progress.
5. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects when the snake eats food or when it collides with itself.
6. **Different Food Types**: Introduce different types of food with varying effects (e.g., slowing down or speeding up the snake).
7. **High Score Tracking**: Save and display the highest score the player has achieved.
